###Farmers and Politics

**Why did farmers think that a new political party was needed to bring about reform?**

The major parties didn’t represent farmers’ interests.

The Republican and Democratic Parties were controlled by bankers and the
landowning elite.

Farmers wanted a voice in government.

Farmers had already had some success at the local level.

Farmers wanted to affect national policy and enact needed reforms.
