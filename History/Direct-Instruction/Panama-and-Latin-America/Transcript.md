There was strong support in the United States for building a canal across Central America, but agreeing that such a canal was needed was only the first step. Building the canal would require a major shift in US policy toward Latin America. American leaders had to decide where to build the canal, find a way to require the land, and overcome serious engineering obstacles before the Panama Canal could become a reality.
Section 2
00:00:00
The two best locations to build a canal were in Panama or Nicaragua. A French company had already tried and failed to build a canal in Panama, giving up in 1889. In 1902, Congress chose Panama because the French company offered to sell the US the land and the building rights for the Panama Canal at a greatly reduced price. The Panama route was shorter.
00:00:27
The US Congress worried about the risks of volcanoes in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan president assured the US there were no volcanoes, but then a US congressman produced a stamp from Nicaragua that showed an active volcano. Before construction could begin, US leaders needed Colombia's permission because Panama was part of Colombia at the time.
00:00:49
A treaty was nearly signed, but then Colombia's government demanded more money. With American encouragement, Panama declared its independence in 1903. President Roosevelt sent US Navy ships to keep Colombian troops from landing in Panama. This action helped Panama secure its independence. Colombia's leaders were outraged.
00:01:11
This political cartoon shows Roosevelt shoveling dirt onto the government of Colombia to build the canal. The US then signed a treaty in 1904 with the new nation of Panama.
Section 4
00:00:02
Engineers and workers building the Panama Canal faced four major construction challenges. They had to blast and dig their way through the mountains of the Continental Divide. The Gaillard Cut seen here is more than eight miles long and ranges from 300 feet wide at the bottom to over 1,700 feet wide at the top. It took thousands of workers, dozens of steam shovels, and
00:00:23
over 60 million pounds of dynamite to complete. Landslides kept filling in the trench requiring more digging. Engineers also built giant locks-- mechanisms that use water to raise and lower ships so the ships could traverse the terrain. The jungle was very hot and humid with rainfall of more than 100 inches per year. Working in these conditions was exhausting.
00:00:47
Rainfall often caused flooding of the rivers, like the Chagres, slowing or halting construction work. Finally, the jungle mosquitoes carried deadly malaria and yellow fever that killed thousands of workers. The US took steps to fight these diseases by spraying areas where mosquitoes bred and by improving the quality of the water supply. By the time the Panama Canal was completed in 1914, it was
00:01:14
celebrated as an engineering marvel. One of the greatest construction projects of history, more than 56,000 workers helped build the canal. More than 5,500 of them died from disease or accidents. The Panama Canal is 50 miles long from the Atlantic to Pacific. It takes a ship about 10 hours on average to pass through.
00:01:36
Three sets of giant locks raise and lower the ships as they travel along the canal. Each lock chamber is 110 feet wide by 1,000 feet long. Engineers built an artificial lake to control flooding and provide a waterway for ships to travel across. The canal was a tremendous boost to the economy of the United States, making it cheaper to ship goods from Europe and the East Coast of the US to the West Coast.
00:02:05
About 1,000 ships carrying goods around the world used the canal the first year it opened. Today, the Panama Canal remains one of the major shipping routes in the world. In 2011, nearly 13,000 ships passed through it. In total, more than 1 million ships have passed through the Panama Canal since it opened in 1914. The canal is currently being enlarged so that even bigger
00:02:31
modern cargo ships will have the ability to use it.
Section 6
00:00:02
President Theodore Roosevelt's willingness to support Panama's Declaration of Independence from Colombia was just one example of his bold, and sometimes controversial, approach to diplomacy which became known as the Big Stick policy. First, let's take a look at the origins of that term.
Section 7
00:00:02
Roosevelt's foreign policy was summed up by the African saying that he liked to quote, "Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far." To Roosevelt, this saying meant that the United States had to be willing to do more than talk. It had to act. It had to show that it was strong and not afraid to get involved in world affairs.
00:00:23
To make the US a true world power, Roosevelt built up the size and power the US Naval fleet, became more aggressive about influencing the nations of Latin America. Latin America is made up of Central, South America, and the Caribbean islands, where Spanish and Portuguese are the main languages. In 1904, Roosevelt helped explain his Big Stick Policy by issuing the Roosevelt Corollary
00:00:50
to The Monroe Doctrine. This was a major change in US policy toward Latin America. President James Monroe issued the Monroe Doctrine in 1823. It had three key points dealing with the Western Hemisphere, which is half the world that contains North and South America. The US promised to leave existing European colonies alone.
00:01:13
The US did not want any new European-controlled colonies created. The US said it would oppose any efforts by European nations to harm our control free countries in the region. President Roosevelt approved of the Monroe Doctrine, but he wanted to expand upon it. The Roosevelt Corollary states that the United States would step in and stop any European nations from interfering with
00:01:41
Latin American affairs. If problems arose, the US government, not European ones, would police any disputes. In effect, Roosevelt was saying that the United States was in charge of the region. In addition to his actions in Panama, President Roosevelt put the Big Stick Policy into action in the Caribbean. As seen in the cartoon, which shows him wading through the
00:02:06
Caribbean Sea, holding his big stick and dragging the US fleet. Roosevelt was willing to use America's military power to influence Caribbean nations and keep the peace. In 1904, the Dominican Republic owed money to several European countries. Before those nations could take action, Roosevelt stepped in.
00:02:29
The US seized control of the republic's customs agency. This meant that the US was collecting the taxes on goods shipped to the Dominican Republic. The US then used this money to pay back the Europeans. In 1906, Roosevelt sent US troops to Cuba to end the Civil War. The US ended up occupying and running the country until 1909, when a new Cuban leader was elected.
Section 9
00:00:02
Outside of the Western Hemisphere, Roosevelt spoke softly more often when dealing with foreign nations. Roosevelt helped negotiate the Treaty of Portsmouth, which ended the Russo-Japanese War. As a neutral party, he played a key role in the peace talks. In 1906, Roosevelt quietly supported Britain and France in their disagreements with Germany over events in Africa. He wanted the US to appear neutral, but he believed that
00:00:30
opposing Germany was in America's best interest. In 1907, Roosevelt signed the Gentleman's Agreement with Japan. In exchange for Japan sending fewer immigrants to America, Roosevelt helped end discrimination against Japanese American students in San Francisco schools. The agreement proved to be an awkward solution, but it demonstrated Roosevelt's desire to solve these problems
00:00:56
diplomatically. Each of these actions show that Roosevelt was willing to use diplomacy when dealing with countries that were not neighbors of the United States.
Section 11
00:00:02
US foreign policy continued to change, as Roosevelt's Vice President William Howard Taft had seen US policy towards Latin America shift. When he became president, Taft shaped US foreign policy towards his own goal. So did Woodrow Wilson, who became president after Taft.
Section 12
00:00:00
[INAUDIBLE] Through Dollar Diplomacy, President Taft tried to help American companies expand, to increase the influence of US banks, and to keep peace and stability in foreign countries. Taft wanted American companies to find new markets throughout Asia and Latin America. This meant protecting US companies, encouraging free
00:00:20
trade, and supporting the Monroe Doctrine to limit European competition in Latin America. Taft wanted foreign governments to borrow money from American banks rather than European banks. He believed that if countries owed money to American banks, they would be friendlier to the United States and to American businesses. Finally, peace was better and safer for business
00:00:43
and trade than war. Taft hoped that Dollar Diplomacy would promote peace and prosperity in other countries, as well as in the United States. Taft put Dollar Diplomacy to the test in Latin America and Asia. Taft supported the rebels who overthrew Nicaragua's dictator in 1909.
00:01:03
Then the US forced the new government to take a loan from American banks. The US also took control of the nation's customs agency. The result was another revolution. US Marines helped end this uprising, but people throughout Latin America were angered by US interference in Nicaragua's affairs. In China, Taft supported US loans to the Chinese
00:01:26
government for various railroad projects. The goal is to promote economic growth in China while increasing American influence there. But the railroad projects failed. Japan and European powers involved in China were angered by American efforts to cut them out of the deals. Dollar Diplomacy was a failure. It was not possible to focus only on business issues when
00:01:50
dealing with foreign nations.
Section 14
00:00:01
Although he supported the Monroe Doctrine, Woodrow Wilson wanted to change US foreign policy once again when he took office. His plan was called Moral Diplomacy. Wilson publicly rejected both the big stick policy and dollar diplomacy. He insisted that American foreign policy in Latin America should be aimed at promoting democracy.
00:00:24
He wanted to support peace, fair constitutions, and personal rights. Wilson's ideals were soon put to the test. President Wilson publicly opposed imperialism, even when it involved US territories. He promoted democracy and personal rights in US territories by supporting US citizenship for Puerto Ricans, and setting up a plan for the Philippines to become
00:00:49
independent. But Wilson still used military force to intervene in Latin American countries. In 1910, Mexico have a revolution. At first, Wilson supported the revolution because he wanted Mexico to have a democracy. But he was unhappy with the leaders who came to power. In 1914, he sent the US Navy and Marines to occupy the
00:01:12
Mexican port of Vera Cruz, hoping to force President Huerta out of office. In 1916, he sent US troops into Mexico to try to capture the Mexican rebel leader, Pancho Villa. Wilson sent US troops to occupy the Caribbean nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In each case, he claimed that the United States was restoring order after revolutionaries had overthrown
00:01:42
earlier governments. Both countries were ruled by American military governments for years. The US troops left the Dominican Republic in 1924, and Haiti in 1934. By the time he left office, President Wilson had used military force to intervene in Latin America just as often as Roosevelt and Taft had done.
00:02:04
His actions in the Caribbean had upset many Latin American leaders.
