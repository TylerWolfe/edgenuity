###Section 1
You are working towards answering the lesson question at the top of your screen. It reads, how did immigration change in the 1800s? In order to answer this question, you've got to break it down a little bit. First, you need to know why immigrants came to America, or the factors causing immigration. Then you need to know about the different waves of immigrants, or the different ways of immigration, in the United States. And finally, you need to understand what the immigration experience was like. You just met Mary Antin in the warmup, and you learned that her family left their home in search of new opportunities. This was just one of many reasons that immigrants had for leaving their homes to come to the United States. In the first part of the lesson, you're going to learn why immigrants were coming to America, and you're going to begin by looking at the most common factors that caused immigration in the 1800s.

###Section 2
Let's have a discussion on why people immigrate. Sometimes people move to get away from something in their old country. For example, they may try to escape oppression or even property. These are called push factors, and they cause people to leave home. They push the immigrants out of their home, as you see in this image here. There are also things called poll factors that draw people to a new country. These are things that attract immigrants, and they pulled immigrants toward the new country, as you see in the image here. And then immigrants are often motivated by both kinds of factors, push and pull. Let's look at some common push and pull factors. As you can see, push and pull factors are often opposites that work together to motivate people to move. You may be pushed out by a war, and you might be pulled in by the prospect of living somewhere peaceful. If you are being attacked for your religion, you may want to seek a place that offers religious freedom. You might even want to leave danger for a place that's safer, or offers more safety. And you might discover that your old country didn't have enough jobs. So you move to a new country for new job opportunities. Or maybe your old country might not have enough opportunities for education. So you move to a new country for new educational opportunities.

###Section 4
Beginning in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, more than 30 million Europeans came to America. And there was a variety of reasons. Let's talk about the push factors first. The push factors included too few jobs and poverty in their home countries, along with the persecution of Jewish people. Now let's talk about the pull factors. Pull factors included, jobs were being created by growing industries in the United States. And in the United States, there was freedom of religion, or religious tolerance. You can see that these push and pull factors were opposite forces. Now, we'll look at this wave of immigrants in a few moments. But first we'll take a look at an older set of immigrants.

###Section 5
You've been working towards answering the lesson question at the top of this screen. And it reads, how did immigration change in the 1800s? You've learned about factors causing immigration. And next, you'll be looking and comparing the various waves of immigrant groups that came to the United States.

###Section 6
By 1800, many immigrants had come from England, Scotland and Wales. In addition, there were a large group of unwilling immigrants, and those were enslaved Africans. Two major waves of immigrants came from Europe, and immigrants also came from Asia. In the early 1800s, a large wave of immigration took shape, and this featured many immigrants coming from western European countries. And during this period, Asian immigration also spiked. The spike was focused on the West Coast because of the California Gold Rush during the mid 1800s and its aftermath. In the late 1800s, the number of immigrants to the United States exploded. These new immigrants were largely from eastern and southern European countries. Take a look at this map on your screen. As immigration spiked in the mid-1800s, most Europeans came from Germany and Ireland. Let's look at the reasons why so many people began coming to the United States from these countries. We have to ask ourselves, what were the push and pull factors working on the Irish and the Germans? Well, the Irish and the German immigrants shared similar motivations. Across Europe, population growth made land shortages worse. Many people, especially those who worked on farms, as in Germany, were out of work. So the big idea here is that both Irish and German immigrants were motivated by a lack of land in Europe. Then in the 1800s, a major famine struck Ireland. During the Irish Potato Famine, in what a fungus destroyed the potato crop throughout the country, about 1 million people died of starvation or related diseases. And about 2 million people left in search for a better life. Germany was in political upheaval. This was due to a failed revolution in 1848, and that revolution was supposed to bring political freedom to the population. So why did people come to the United States? Well, there were millions of acres of land available. Many jobs were now available because of the Industrial Revolution. And the United States offered peace and stability.

###Section 9
Let's map out where most immigrants were coming from, beginning in the late 1880s. In this era, growing number of immigrants came from these regions. They came from Italy, Poland, Russia, the Balkans, and from southern Europe. Let's look at what motivated these new immigrants to come to America. And remember, by new immigration, we mean immigration in the late 1800s as opposed to old immigration from before. So there are many push factors that drove immigrants from Europe. And they included widespread poverty. Many Europeans were being forced out of their countries because of widespread poverty. They didn't have enough to get by. Also, many people were losing their land. People lost their land or couldn't find enough land to survive. Millions of people were unemployed, as new technology and needs changed the number and kinds of jobs available. Also, we had persecution in many of the European countries. Persecution is the mistreatment of racial or religious groups. So more than 30 million Europeans left the continent in search of a better life in America in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This is because the immigrants believed that America was safe and had many resources. Now take a look at this image. America had plenty of opportunity. The growth of industry in the United States created the need for a large work pool. You'll continue to examine these factors as we look closely at groups of immigrants that came in the late 1800s. So you know where the old immigrants and new immigrants came from, and why they immigrated to the United States. Now you can begin to compare the old immigrants with the new immigrants. Old immigrants, they came from western or northern Europe, whereas the new immigrants came from eastern or southern Europe. Old immigrants were often landowners, skilled laborers, or merchants, whereas the new immigrants were usually unskilled workers or farmers. Old immigrants were usually Protestant or Catholic, whereas the new immigrants were typically Catholic or Jewish. And most of the old immigrants settled in the United States, whereas the new immigrants often returned to their home countries. So despite their many differences, both the old and new immigrants shared many experiences. And some of those experiences were that they created their own ethnic neighborhoods, and they often lived in cities. They also maintained their cultures in some way, oftentimes by creating schools, newspapers, and places of worship. And both of these groups had to deal with anti-immigrant sentiments. Newcomer's are often an easy target when times get hard.

###Section 11
You need to know about one more important immigrant group, and that is the Chinese. While the Irish and the Germans dominated east coast immigration, the Chinese began flocking to the west coast. By 1851, Chinese immigrants were seeking gold in California's gold rush and they called California the "Gold Mountain". Few found gold, so they looked for work. Many found it working in the transcontinental railroads. This work was hard and very dangerous. In addition to anti-immigrant feelings many immigrants faced, the Chinese were subject to abuse and violence because of their racial differences. Laws also made life in the United States hard for the Chinese. The American laws kept the Chinese out of government jobs, public schools, and the laws outlawed Chinese customs. Finally, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted immigration. This Act kept Chinese laborers out of the country and it denied citizenship for those already in the country.

###Section 13
You've been working towards answering the lesson question, which reads, how did immigration change in the 1800s? You now understand the factors causing immigration, and the reasons why people chose to immigrate to the United States in the 1800s. You also learned to recognize the various waves of immigration. Now it's time to learn about the immigrant experience. What did immigrants experience as they came and lived in the United States? Think back to the warm-up. Remember Mary Antin? What was life like for her? What would it be like if you were an immigrant? What would you experience?

###Section 14
From 1892 to 1954, millions of European immigrants entered through Ellis Island Immigration Station in New York. After hard, long journeys aboard ships, immigrants had more waiting to do before they got to their new home. Entering the United States could be a tiring process that took hours or even days. The immigrants had to wait to be questioned, and this could take a long time. Immigrate officials would ask you questions about why are you here, what are your plans, and so forth. Immigrants also had to go through medical exams, as you see in the picture here. The examiners were looking for signs of disease and/or illness. The immigrants were also required to fill out paperwork. And usually they had to answer questions, again, about their future plans. Usually most immigrants were detained only briefly, for a matter of a few hours. However, some were held for longer. As you've learned, immigrants from China and other Asian nations kept coming to the United States despite extreme prejudice and legislation to keep them out. Most arrived first on the West Coast in California at Angel Island Immigration Station, that you see pictured here. And it opened in 1910 in San Francisco. Most immigrants that were entering the United States, were coming to this station from China and Japan. And just like Ellis Island, doctors examined these immigrants, looking for signs of illness and/or disease. Officials checked out the immigrants papers, and the immigrants were forced to go through serious interrogations. The Chinese immigrants work closely interrogated. Questioning could last for a long time, as they waited for witnesses to arrive. Immigrants often waited at Angel Island for weeks, and some were detained for even months.

###Section 16
Let's think about where immigrants settled first. Here is a map that shows generally where immigrant groups settled in the late 1800s. While immigrants spread all across the country, they often settled together with others from their home country. Each immigrant group tended to settle in a certain region. Let's look at a few groups of immigrants to see where they settled in the years between 1890 and 1910. Germans and Scandinavians, they tended to settle in New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Washington, and you can see that in the image here. Germans and Norwegians and other Scandinavians tended to settle in what is now the Midwest. And many other groups were drawn to the cities. Chinese immigration tended to remain on the west coast of the United States. Whereas Italians, Irish, Russians, and other Europeans tended to move to New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Illinois. Finally, there were many places in where many of these groups overlapped. You just saw that many immigrants felt the pull of cities. And in the late 1800s, most immigrants settled in major cities because these major cities were close to the points of entry, or as close to the place where they arrived in the country from. Cities also offered many job opportunities. They also offered many available resources. Cities were also home to many people with the same heritage as themselves. And the great thing about cities was that living in the cities helped immigrants maintain their traditional culture.

###Section 18
As large waves of immigrants came to the United States, they did not always receive a warm welcome. Some native residents distrusted or disliked anyone who differed from themselves in dress, language, or religion. Now, nativism is a feeling of resentment toward immigrants or people who are not native citizens. Many Americans held nativist opinions. They wrongfully accused immigrants of the following. They accused them of taking jobs, driving up crime rates, and bringing poverty and disease into the country. Now, nativism grew stronger when times were hard. So this increased the anti-immigrant feelings.
