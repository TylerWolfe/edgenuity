**A boy on a skateboard is pushed down the sidewalk by a friend. The skateboard rolls for a while but eventually comes to a stop. What force is causing the skateboard to stop rolling?**

friction

**Explain the motions of a hockey puck during a hockey game in terms of Newton's first law.**

A net force is applied to the puck by a player, the puck moves off at a constant velocity until another net force is applied by another player to change its motion.

**Two crates, one heavy and one light, are at rest on a waxed floor. Which crate will need the greater force to give the same change in speed? Explain.**

The larger crate will need more force because force is directly proportional to mass.

**You push a heavy crate. At first it doesn't move. You push harder, and it finally starts to move, but you still have to exert some force to keep it moving at a constant velocity. Explain.**

At first you had to exert a large force to overcome static friction. After the crate started to move, you have to exert a smaller force to overcome sliding friction.

**Why do warehouse workers move heavy boxes around on carts with wheels?**

Rolling friction is less than sliding friction.

**Explain why Galileo's thought experiment about the ball rolling forever on a level surface could only be a thought experiment.**

In the real world there is always some friction between the ball and the surface.

**Explain how Galileo used a thought experiment of a ball on a ramp to conclude that an object would stay in constant motion if no net force acted on it.**

The ball rolled up the ramp and stopped. As the ramp was lowered, the ball rolled farther. If the ramp were perfectly smooth and level, the ball should continue forever if nothing disturbed it.

**You push on a crate with a force of 10 N to the right, and your friend pushes on the crate with a force of 25 N to the left. Describe and explain the motion of the crate.**

The crate accelerates to the left because there is a net force of 15 N acting to the left.

**Explain what the net force on an object will be if balanced forces act on it.  What will happen to the net force if unbalanced forces act on an object?**

When balanced forces act on an object, they cancel each other out, so the net force is zero. The forces do not cancel each other out when unbalanced forces act on an object, so the net force will not be zero.

**Compare and contrast the three types of friction.**

Static friction is caused by the interactions of atoms on two surfaces that touch each other. Static friction keeps objects at rest. Sliding friction is like static friction, but it slows down moving objects. Rolling friction acts between a flat surface and a the part of a wheel touching the ground. It keeps tires from slipping on the ground. The rolling friction of a car would be less than the sliding friction of a car.
