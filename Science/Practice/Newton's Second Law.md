*Assume that all of the objects in the diagram are solid and made of the same material.*

**In Set A, what would you have to do to the objects to make the gravitational forces between the objects in pair 2 the same as the forces between the objects in pair 1?**

Either move the objects in pair 1 closer together or those in pair 2 farther apart.

**When ____________________ equals the force of gravity on a falling object, the object reaches terminal velocity.**

*Assume that all of the objects in the diagram are solid and made of the same material.*

**In Set A, is the gravitational force greater between the objects in pair 1 or pair 2? Explain why.**

The gravitational force between the objects in pair 2 is greater because the objects have a greater mass than those in pair 1.
