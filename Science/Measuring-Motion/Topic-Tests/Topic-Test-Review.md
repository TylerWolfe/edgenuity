**1. Gives a pictorial indication of how far and fast an object has moved**

Frame of reference

**2. ____________ acceleration involves speeding up, while ____________ acceleration involves slowing down.**

a. positive, negative

**3. The greater the mass is in an object, the higher resistance to a change in movement the object will have.**

True

**4. A 50-kg object moving at 12 m/s has a momentum of 600 kg ´ g m/s. What is the mass of an object, moving at 4 m/s that has the same momentum?**

p = mv; 600 kg x m/s = 4m/s(m); m = 150 kg

**5. A plane is flying due east in still air at 395 km/h. Suddenly, the plane is hit by wind blowing at 55 km/h toward the west. What is the resultant velocity of the plane?**

340 km/h due east

**6. A Transair plane is flying east at 275 km/h. A Worldair plane is flying west at 275 km/h. Are the two planes flying at the same velocity? Explain your answer.**

No. The planes are flying at the same speed, but in different directions. Therefore, the velocities are different.

**7. Why is acceleration measured in meters / seconds squared?**

This is because to find acceleration, you must divide velocity by time. Velocity is measured in meters / second, and time is measured in seconds. So, when meters / second is divided by seconds, the units become meters / second squared.

**8. What is the total momentum between two identical balls traveling toward each other at the same speed from opposite directions?**

Zero.

**9. Define velocity.**

Velocity is the rate of change of position or the speed of an object in a particular direction.

**10. Suppose that you are running down the street at 6 m/sec.  You see your dog ahead and speed up to 10 m/sec over 20 sec to catch him.  What is your acceleration in m/s2?**

(10 m/sec-6 m/sec)/ 20 sec = 0.2 m/sec2

**11. Light travels at a speed of 3.0 ´ 108 m/s. If it takes light from the sun 5.0 ´ 102 s to reach Earth, what is the distance between Earth and the sun?**

1.5 ´ 1011 m or 1.5 ´ 108 km

**12. A compact car with a mass of 725 kg is moving at 30 m/s. What is its momentum?**

p = mv = 725 kg x 30 m/s = 21,750 kg x m/s

**13. When you hit a baseball with a bat, how is momentum transferred?**

Some of the momentum from the bat is transferred to the ball. This momentum allows the ball to fly into the outfield.

**14. If you are skateboarding and have to make a sharp turn to avoid a branch, in which direction are you accelerating?**

You are accelerating in the same direction as your turn.

**15. Explain why a constant speed has a slope of 0 on a graph of speed v. time.**

A constant speed has a slope of zero because no acceleration is taking place.
