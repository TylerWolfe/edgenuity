balanced forces: Two or more forces whose effects cancel each other out and do not change the motion of an object.

force: A push or pull.

friction: The force that one surface exerts on another when the two surfaces rub against one another.

net force: A combination of all of the forces acting on an object.

Newton's first law of motion: States that if the net force acting on an object is zero, the object will remain at rest or move in a straight line with a constant speed.

unbalanced forces: Two or more forces acting on an object that do not cancel and cause the object to accelerate.
