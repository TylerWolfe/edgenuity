**balanced forces:** Two or more forces whose effects cancel each other out and do not change the motion of an object.

**force:** A push or pull.

**friction:** The force that one surface exerts on another when the two surfaces rub against one another.

**net force:** A combination of all of the forces acting on an object.

**Newton's first law of motion:** States that if the net force acting on an object is zero, the object will remain at rest or move in a straight line with a constant speed.

**unbalanced forces:** Two or more forces acting on an object that do not cancel and cause the object to accelerate.

**acceleration:** Equals the change in velocity divided by the time for the change to take place; occurs when an object speeds up, slows down or turns.

**air resistance:** The fluid friction experienced by objects falling through the air.

**fluid friction:** Friction that occurs as an object moves through a fluid.

**free fall:** The motion of a falling object when the only force acting on it is gravity.

**friction:** A force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact.

**gravity:** The force that pulls objects toward each other.

**mass:** The amount of matter in an object.

**projectile:** An object that is thrown.

**rolling friction:** Rotating on an axis, or moving along a surface by rotation; turning over and over as if on an axis or a pivot as, a rolling wheel or ball.

**sliding friction:** Friction that occurs when one solid surface slides over another.

**static friction:** Friction that acts on objects that are not moving.

**terminal velocity:** The greatest velocity a falling object can achieve.

**weight:** A measurement of force that depends on gravity; measured in newtons.

**displacement:** The change in position of an object.

**motion:** An object's change in position relative to a reference point.

**speed:** The distance traveled by an object divided by the time interval during which the motion occurred.

**velocity:** The speed of an object in a particular direction.
