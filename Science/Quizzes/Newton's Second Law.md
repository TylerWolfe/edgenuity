**A boy finds an abandoned mine shaft in the woods, and wants to know how deep the hole is. He drops in a stone, and counts 4 seconds before he hears the "plunk" of the stone hitting the bottom of the shaft. Approximately how deep is the shaft? Assume a gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 and no significant air resistance.(Hint: d=at2/2)**

78 meters

**The graphs below show the height vs. time (teal), velocity vs. time (green), and acceleration vs. time (blue) for a shuttlecock. Which statement is true?**

The shuttlecock began 7 meters above the ground, and fell through a vacuum.

**If a cotton ball is dropped from 12 meters with air resistance, what will be the velocity and acceleration at t = 1.00 s?**

v = -2.55 m/s, a = -0.02 m/s2

**When a Lunar Module landed on the Moon, it used thrusters to slow its descent to the surface. When other spacecraft are returned to Earth, they use parachutes to slow their descent. Why wouldn't a parachute be useful on the Moon?**

There is no air on the Moon, so there is no air resistance and the parachute would be ineffective.

**The diagram below shows the acceleration vs. time for a falling object. What was true about the object at 0.5 seconds?**

The object reached terminal velocity.
