Hi, and welcome to today's lesson in physical science. My name's Mr. [? Provancha ?], and today we're going to talk about Newton's second law. There's four objectives in today's lesson. But first we're gonna talk about what Newton's second law actually is, and we'll describe it. We'll talk about how it affects or how it describes motion determined by forces. And we'll identify the factors that affect gravitational force. And then we'll explain why objects accelerate during free fall and talk about how objects accelerate during free fall. So what is Newton's second law? I like to think of it this way. Newton's second law says unbalanced forces cause acceleration. Forces cause acceleration, but they have to be unbalanced. You have to have what's called a net force. A net force is the sum of all forces. It's the sum of all forces put together. And if there is net force-- which means that they don't cancel each other out. If they don't balance out or they don't cancel out, there will be acceleration. For instance, right now I'm standing on the ground, gravity is pulling me down, and the ground's pushing back up. I know I'm balance because I'm not moving. I'm not accelerating. If the ground was to be taken out from underneath me, gravity would win, and I would have a net force in the down direction and I would accelerate downward. And there's an equation just from the relationship of these, that acceleration equals your net force divided by mass. Sometimes it looks like this, F divided m. But this is the net force. And the common way that the most of the world remembers this equation, like your parents might hear this equation, is just F equals ma. That's how it's said, and that's what it is right here. Really, these are the same thing. They've just been rearranged to have different variables by themselves. Just algebraically been moved around. And the units for a force is called a Newton. And Newton is equal to 1 kilogram meter per second squared. Let me explain what that means. It takes is 1 Newton of force-- let's say my pen right here is a kilogram-- so it takes 1 Newton of force to accelerate this 1-kilogram object at 1 meter per second per second. So if you want to accelerate this pen at 1 meter per second for every second that you're pushing on it, then you apply with 1 Newton. So 1 Newton is how much force is needed to accelerate a 1-kilogram object at 1 meter per second squared. That's that by definition. Now, part of the second law also states that the acceleration that occurs is always in the direction of the net force. For instance, you're having a tug of war. As long as the forces are balanced in a tug of war, no one's moving. No one's accelerating. But as soon as somebody starts to win, let's say the boy's-- looks like the girl's actually winning-- if the girl's pulling harder and there's a net force in the girl's direction, well, this boy will be accelerated in her direction, and she'll move that direction as well. They'll both be moving. In tug of wars, usually the winning team always goes back and the losing team goes forward into the mud pit or whatever they have there. So acceleration's always in the direction of the net force. If you kick a ball, that direction, the ball's going to go that direction. All Newton's laws are common sense because it's what we see every day. They are laws that we recognize to be true, because we experience them every day. Now let's do practice problem in terms of calculating acceleration using Newton's second law. Here's a practice problem that says, a net force of 4,500 Newtons-- remember that's a force-- acts on a car with a mass of 1,500 kilograms. What is the acceleration of the car? Well once again, we write down unknown. Our unknown is acceleration. And we know the units is going to be meters per second squared. And then our knowns, we know the force is 4,500 Newtons. So we put that here. And we know the mass is 1,500 kilograms. So we bring that down here, and we put them there. So we have them ready to use. We put down the equation of a equals F over m. Sometimes it kind of looks hard with that net there. a equals F over m, so force divided by mass. And once we have our equation, we plug in the numbers in there. So we take our force and plug it in for the F. We take our mass and plug it in for the m. And then now we just have to do math. Take 4,500 divided by 1,500, and we get 3. Now, the units on this, remember-- So if we have 4,500-- a Newton is the same thing as a kilogram meter per second squared-- divided by 1,500 kilograms. So unit-wise, our kilograms cancel out, and we're left with meters per second squared, which is what we want, because that's the units for acceleration. So there's our answer 3.0 meters per second squared. Now let's talk about gravity. Gravity falls into Newton's second law, because we experience gravity based on an unbalanced-- as a force. Now, the universal law of gravity, which is one of Newton's laws, basically states that anything that has matter has a gravitational field around it and will attract other objects. And so he has a relationship here, he has this equation, that the force of gravity equals-- This is just a number. It's a large number. You don't have to worry about it. But it equals one mass times the second mass divided by the distance between them squared. So the gravity between objects depends on how large each object is-- so the more mass of these objects are, the more gravity they're going to exert-- and how far apart the objects are. The earth is a very massive object. And so no matter what system it is, if the earth is mass one, you already have a huge number in that system. So no matter how small, if it's a person or whether it's the moon, you're going to have a lot of gravity. And the farther away you get from the earth, the less gravity you're going to have pulling on you. So astronauts that are way out in space literally don't have as much gravity pulling on them just because they're further away. Now there is a difference between mass and weight. Mass is how much matter you have in you. Weight is equal to your mass times the acceleration due to gravity. And we're going to get to that just next. So it's equal to mass times acceleration. And it's a force. Weight is a force. It's how hard gravity is pulling on you. And so this acceleration we're talking about, all objects accelerate at 9.8 meters per second squared. And I'm going to try to explain this using a combination of Newton's first and Newton's second law together. If you have a big object up here, and it's going to fall off a cliff, and you have a small object, both of these objects are going to fall at the same rate. Now, this takes out takes out air resistance. So air resistance, we know if you drop a feather, it's not going to fall at the same rate as a rock because air gets in the way. Let's take away that. We'll call it Physical Science World. But if you took out the air resistance, these objects would fall at the same rate. Now, the reason why these objects fall at the same rate is-- let me try to explain it this way-- is that the big object, it has big inertia. Remember, inertia is an object's willingness not to change. So that big rock has big inertia. It does not want to move. The little rock has just a little inertia. That's a little i right there. And so it doesn't take much to get it to move. Now, gravity works in such a way that the more mass you have, the more gravitational pull you're going to have on the object. And the mass you have, the smaller gravity you have pulling. And so on the big object you have a lot of inertia, but you have a lot of gravity pulling down on it. And so it accelerates it at 9.8 meters per second squared. The small object has a little inertia, but it also has a little force acting on it. And so it also accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared. All objects that fall fall at the same rate, because it's a balance between inertia and the pull of gravity. They both grow the same rate. As mass grows, inertia and the pull of gravity both grow at the same rate. And so you get a canceling out. And so you always get the same number there, every time. Now, the only time you're not going to be falling at 9.8 is if there's air resistance in a way. Think of air resistance as friction. It gets in the way. For instance, this skydiver right here, when he first jumps out of the airplane, he's going to start accelerating at 9.8. However, his acceleration slows down because air, here is right here, as he falls-- If he just a had gravity pulling him down, he was a fall at 9.8. However, you know as you stick your hand out the window of a car, the faster you go, the more resistance you have from the air outside. If you're going really fast, you stick your hand out there, it's almost harder to keep it up. But if you're just stationary, you don't feel anything at all. And so the faster this guy falls, the more and more and more this air friction grows. And it'll keep growing until it reaches the same size as gravity. And that's when you're at what's called a terminal velocity. You're at the maximum velocity you're going to reach, because friction and gravity are balanced and you're no longer accelerating. You're just maintaining a very fast speed, falling on the way down. So air resistance, parachuters use it. That's how they stop. So they're very thankful for it. The parachute's job is to increase air friction to be very big, which accelerates them in opposite directions, slows them down very quickly, and so that when they hit the ground they're not going too fast. Now, one more thing I do want to talk about is something called a projectile. A projectile is any object that is going through the air. It can be going sideways. It can be falling down. Now, if you were just to take this right here, as a ball falls it's speeding up and speeding up and speaking up. And so if we took this still-frame photography, where the picture was taken at repetitions that are constant, we see that the ball is falling further and further with each time frame. That's because it's going faster and faster. What's really fascinating to me is that if an object is moving sideways, see how these balls are actually lining up perfectly. They are falling at the exact same rate, whether or not they are falling straight down or whether they are pushed to the side. Horizontal motion, if an object's moving sideways, has no effect on how fast an object falls. And this is a thing I usually give my students, that if you were to stand here and were to shoot a gun, just flat out on the ground, just straight, and you let drop a bullet at the same time, and you got rid of all air friction-- let's just say you're in outer space on the moon, you were to shoot it-- that bullet, as this one's falling, it's going to be getting lower and lower into the ground. And as it comes out, it's going to eventually hit the ground. This one's just going to fall straight to the ground, but they're both going to hit the ground at the same time. Yes, this one will land maybe a mile away. But they will hit the ground at the same time, because gravity really doesn't care whether you're moving or not. It's going to pull on you at the same rate. It's going to pull at you with the same strength. And so you're still going to accelerate at that same rate. So that's today's lesson. We talk about Newton's second law. Remember, unbalanced forces cause acceleration. The relationship is force equals mass times acceleration, F equals ma. And we talked about the direction of the force. The direction of the net force is going to tell you what direction the object will accelerate. And we talked about the factors that determine gravitational force. Remember, that's the mass of the two objects involved and also the distance between the two objects. And then we talked about how all objects accelerate at 9.8 during free fall in the absence of air friction. So that's today's lesson. Hope it helped. Have a great day. Take care.
