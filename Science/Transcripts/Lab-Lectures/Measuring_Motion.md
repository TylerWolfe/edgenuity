Hi. Today, we're be measuring motion, looking at distance time and speed time graphs. We're going to relate speed to distance and time, as well distinguish the difference between speed and velocity. Also, we'll be solving problems related to time, distance, displacement, speed, and velocity. In order to help us out, today we will be using a gizmo. In today's gizmo, we're able to look at the distance time and velocity time graphs. What we can do is select a runner to go ahead and run a different distance. And we can look at a velocity time graph or the distance traveled or we can just keep these controls and watch this graph over here. So let's go ahead and click on the stopwatch and see what happens. So when the clock is going, you can go ahead and stop. Watch the runner who's moving and we'll stop it again. So what is happening, is we're seeing the distance from the starting line and the overall time on the x-axis. We can adjust where the distance from the starting line is. And you note that the runner is in a different spot. We can also adjust where he will end up. So if he's beginning at 20 yards from the starting line and he ends up 0 yards from the starting line, that means he'll end up back at the starting line. Let's look what happens at this time interval. Notice that he is going in the opposite direction. Now then, let's look at a velocity time graph. Note that the velocity here is negative. Why is the velocity negative when he was moving? Well, the difference between speed, or distance versus time, and velocity is the distance and the direction it moved divided by the time interval. So you can have negative velocities. But you cannot have a negative speed. Let's look at this graph of distance traveled. Note that the distance traveled is positive for all values. You can't have a negative distance traveled. However, your displacement can be negative. Your displacement is your distance from your starting point or your amount of space away from your starting point. So if I were to start at 20 and end up back at the 0 starting line, I could have a negative displacement. But the distance is always going to be positive. Now then, let's look at what else we can do, is we can pick another runner. Let me show the animation here. So let's say that this runner is going to be running here. Note that the runners are in the same starting spot, but they're going to end up in a different place. This means their speeds are different. So as you see, the runners are in motion, but they are moving at a different speed or one covers a different amount of distance in the same time interval as the other runner. We can also look at more points. Currently, we have two. Let's look at what happens if their speeds or their velocities are not the same. Let's say that the runner in blue was going very quickly and then leveled off, while the next runner continued to get faster. Note what happens as the race begins. The runner in blue gets a really big lead, perhaps slows down for some reason. And then the runner in red is able to over pass the runner in blue. This is happening because there are different speeds. And throughout, the speed is not consistent. If we look at a velocity time graph, we can see how the blue runner was much faster, had a much higher velocity, and then slowed down, considerably. While the runner in red was able to overtake him. The distance traveled graph shows this as well, showing that the runner in red went a further distance.
