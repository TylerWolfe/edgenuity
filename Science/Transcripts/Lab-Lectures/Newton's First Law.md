###Section 1

Hi. Today we're gonna be looking at Newton's first law. We're gonna use an Atwood machine in order to help us distinguish between balanced and net forces. We're also gonna be using a gizmo today in order to help us. In today's gizmo an Atwood machine helps us to look at Newton's first law, an object in motion will continue in motion unless there's some force acting upon it. Also, an object at rest will stay at rest unless there's a force acting upon it. Now, if an object is balanced that means it's not gonna be in motion because the forces upon it are all zero. Now, in this example, we have an Atwood machine, which is really quite simple to build in any physics laboratory. What you can do is simply have a pulley system, and the pulley itself is a solid disk. So you can have it suspended. And let's see what happens when we go ahead and have our masses set. We can have one mas set at two kilograms and one at three kilograms. So you have the blue mass at three, and the red mass at 2.03 kilograms. What's gonna happen when we set these in motion? Well, if they're both teetering on a pulley or they're connected to the same cord or the same rope, you know that they're connected. So we can show a force diagram to see what the overall forces are, and with the numbers. One of these forces is bigger than the other. Obviously, 29 is bigger than 19. So you know the one with the bigger force is gonna be having more pull on the pulley. So let's see what happens when we go ahead and set this in play. So we play. The one with the bigger force is gonna pull the rope, right. When does it stop? Well, when it hits the ground, which is another force. Let's go ahead and watch this one more time with a bar graph. So let's reset that and see what happens. Once again the blue is coming down towards the ground while the lighter mass is getting pulled up. One more time. Let's look on this graph which shows the velocity versus time as well. Note that the velocity are increasing-- the velocity is increasing for the red and decreasing for the blue because they're going in opposite directions. When we look at the table of the data, the velocities are actually equal to each other but just in opposite directions. The velocity at all points are equal but opposite in direction. All right. One last thing, let's see what happens if we were to set both of these to three kilograms. What do you think would happen? Note that their forces are equal. So are they balanced? Let's go ahead and hit Play. What's gonna happen is that if there's a balanced force, there's gonna be no motion. An object at rest will stay at rest unless there is some net force acting upon. Here the net force is 0. They have balanced forces.
