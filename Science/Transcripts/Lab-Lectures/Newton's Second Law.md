Hi. Today we will be looking at friction and gravity as well as a freefall laboratory in order to help us explain why it is that objects accelerate during freefall. In order to help us, we will be using a gizmo today. In today's gizmo, we're able to look at three different objects that are going to be dropped, and we're going to see them during freefall. Freefall means that time when the object is dropped and the only thing acting upon it is gravity. The first thing that we're going to be seeing is a tennis ball that is going to be dropped in a vacuum. Now vacuum means that the air molecules are out of the system, and they're not going to be slowing the object down. So the object will not be hitting any other molecules as it goes through from when we drop it to when it stops. Let's go ahead and select our height at 2 meters, and we, once again, have this in a vacuum. So we're going to hit Play and see what happens. Of course, the tennis ball bounces because that's what tennis balls do well. And we can see that it's now stopped. We can also go over to our table and look at our data. Our data is collected. Involves the time interval. The y value or the height of the object. Note at the height started at 2 meters, and then it went down to 0. Remember that the ball also bounced several times. We can also look at the velocity. Note that the velocity was negative because we were calling downwards negative. And then we can look at the acceleration in meters per second per second, or meters per second squared. Throughout this entire experiment, through all freefall, the acceleration was negative 9.80. That is the value for gravity, negative 9.80 meters per second squared. The only acceleration that was happening was gravity upon this. And that's what happens in freefall when an object is simply dropped. We can also look at a graph of the acceleration. Note that the graph of the acceleration includes a couple little spots, one, two, three, four, five of them where there is a little blip in the graph. Besides that, the graph is constant. Those little blips indicate when the ball hit the ground and it bounced back up. At those points, we don't have the acceleration defined. All right. So let's go ahead and reset, and let's pick a cotton ball. Let's have this dropped in a vacuum. Interestingly, in a vacuum, the cotton ball also has an acceleration of negative 9.80 meters per second squared. It might be interesting to you to think of a cotton ball dropping that quickly or at that acceleration, the same as a tennis ball. Now then, is that always going to be the case? Well not exactly. Let's look at the cotton ball if it were dropped in air like you've normally lived your life. In this situation, the cotton ball is going to have an acceleration of well, it starts at negative 9.8, but you see that the acceleration does not stay at that. We see that acceleration goes from negative 9.80 all the way to 0. All right? Let's look at one other object. Let's look at a birdie. Perhaps you play badminton. Well, we know what the object is going to look like in the vacuum, right? Now then, let's see what happens to the birdie if we have it in freefall in thick air, not just normal air but thick air. We're going to drop the birdie straight down. And we can see a variation from the negative 9.80. It goes from negative 8, negative 7, negative 6, negative 4, and we do see a variance in this. In thick air, the object is slowing down or the acceleration is decreasing from its normal rate that we see in a vacuum.
