Newton's First Law. Objectives-- the objectives for this lesson on Newton's first law are threefold. One, we will distinguish between balanced and net forces. Two, we will describe Newton's first law of motion, and three, we will explain how friction affects motion. Force-- what is a force? A force is a push or pull on an object. Forces can be combined, resulting in net forces, or they can oppose each other. When forces oppose one another, they can be balanced or unbalanced. An example of a balanced force is when you are walking on thin ice but not falling through. The force of gravity acting on you is balanced by the force of the ice pushing in the opposite direction. If you fall through the thin ice, this would be an example of unbalanced forces at work. Newton's first law of motion-- Newton's first law of motion is called the law of inertia. This law simply states that physical objects have inertia. If they are at rest, they tend to remain at rest. And if they are in motion, they tend to remain in motion, unless another force is acting on it. Friction-- a good example of an opposing force to an object in motion is friction. Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other. Imagine a car's parked on a steep hill. The friction that keeps the car from sliding down the hill is called static friction. Imagine again you see a car parked on a steep hill. But this time, the hill is covered with a sheet of ice. Static friction is overcome and the car begins to slide down the hill. Now the friction involved is called kinetic friction. And this type of friction can be shown by either sliding or rolling. So in review, we distinguished between balanced and net forces. We described Newton's first law of motion, and we explained how friction affects motion.
