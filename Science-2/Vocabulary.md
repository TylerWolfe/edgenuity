**compression:** The part of a longitudinal wave where the particles of the medium are close together.

**crest:** The highest point of a wave.

**energy:** The capacity to do work.

**longitudinal wave:** A wave that moves a medium in a direction parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.

**mechanical wave:** A wave that requires a medium through which to travel.

**medium:** The material through which a wave travels.

**rarefaction:** The part of a longitudinal wave where the particles of the medium are far apart.

**transverse wave:** A wave that moves the medium in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels.

**trough:** The lowest point of a transverse wave.

**vibration:** A repeated back and forth or up and down motion.

**wave:** A disturbance that transfers energy from place to place.

**amplitude:** The maximum distance that the particles of a wave's medium vibrate from their rest position.

**Doppler effect:** An observed change in the frequency of a wave when the source or observer is moving.

**frequency:** The number of cycles or vibrations per unit of time; also the number of waves produced in a given amount of time.

**period:** The time that it takes a complete cycle or wave oscillation to occur.

**wavelength:** The distance from any point on a wave to an identical point on the next wave.
