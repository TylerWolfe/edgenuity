**Check only one of the four wave sources. Turn on Show Detector. Click Play. Drag the detector around and watch the signal strength. How does the signal strength change as the detector gets closer to the source?**

The signal strength increases.

**Wave pulses that occur at the same frequency and at the same phase will have crests that overlap (line-up). These crests combine to form a more intense wave. This is known as constructive interference. Which set or sets of waves will result in constructive interference?**

sets 1 and 3

**Constructive interference is an increase in wave strength that occurs when waves of the same frequency meet at the same point. The area on the path where the maximum signal strength is the greatest is the beam of constructive interference. Where is the beam of constructive interference in the diagram above?**

145Â°
