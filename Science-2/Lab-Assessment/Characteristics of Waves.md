**The Doppler effect applies to light waves as well as sound waves. Astronomers use this to measure the motion of stars and galaxies. In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that light from distant galaxies was shifted away from the blue end of the spectrum and towards the red end of the spectrum. Red light has a longer wavelength (and a lower frequency) than blue light. What could Hubble conclude about these galaxies?**

The distant galaxies are moving away from the Earth.

**Based on what you have seen in this Gizmo, what is the best definition of the Doppler effect?**

A change in the frequency of a wave caused by the motion of the source relative to the observer.

**What type of motion is illustrated in the diagram below?**

Oscillating motion slower than the speed of sound.

**The car below emits sound waves, represented by red circles, that are heard by an observer. Based on the pattern of sound waves, what is the direction and speed of the car?**

Away from the observer, slower than the speed of sound.

**Assuming the speed of sound is 340 m/s, what is the most likely speed of the jet shown below?**

340 m/s
