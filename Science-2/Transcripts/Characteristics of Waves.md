Hi. Welcome to today's lesson in physical science. My name is Mr. [? Provancha. ?] And I'll be your instructor today. Today, we're going to be learning about the characteristics of waves or what makes up a wave and how do we measure different parts of a wave. There's some new words that we're going to be learning today. [INAUDIBLE] talk about the terms called a crest, a trough, amplitude, and wavelength of a wave. And then we're also going to be talking about frequency and period and talk about the difference between those two. And then we're going to start using our understanding of waves to calculate wave speed--to calculate frequency and wavelength, as well. And then we're going to learn about something called the Doppler effect, which to me is one of the neater things out in the natural world. So let's talk about waves. We see a picture over here of a wave. And a couple terms that we need to know-- this is a transverse wave where we're shaking it back and forth. And the wave is moving that direction. And what we have here is the crest right here. And this would be a trough right here. So we have three crests and two troughs on this. So the crest-- think like the crest of a wave. I think that's a term you're familiar with, and then trough--just like a feeding trough down at the bottom. So, for once, scientists use something that makes sense in terms of the names. And then the other word that we need to learn about today is amplitude. Amplitude is a measurement from where the substance would normally be to where it goes to. And that can be either direction. It can be from there to there or there to there. It doesn't have to be up. It could be up or down. And you can measure the amplitude. It's just literally the distance from the equilibrium spot to the top of the crest or to the bottom of the trough. And then the term wavelength--a wavelength is the distance-- we measure it in meters or centimeters-- usually it's in meters, though-- and notice-- do you see this little symbol here-- that's what we actually use. The wavelength is that symbol right there. It's a little lambda. It's a Greek letter. But wavelength-- we measure it in meters-- and it's a measurement of distance between two parts of the wave that repeat itself. So, here, we're going-- a crest. And then we go to the next crest. So there's a repetition right there from crest to crest. We could take a wavelength-- notice they even take it from the middle of the wave to the middle of the next wave. Notice they don't take it to here. That would only be half a wave. It has to go all the way to this part right here. So it has to be the same part of the wave. You could go from trough to trough. You could go from here to there. All of those are wavelengths-- so, from there to there and there to there-- those would all be wavelengths. And the term a period-- the period is how long it takes for a wave to pass by. And we measure period-- it's a time. We measure period and time-- we measure it in seconds. So if a period of a wave is four seconds, that means that just while we're sitting there, it takes four seconds from one wave-- from one crest to come in-- and then followed by the second crest. So if you're sitting on the beach, and one wave comes in, and let's say a half a second passes, and the second wave comes in, that means the period of those waves would be 0.5 seconds. So that's a period. Like I said, period is time. The term frequency-- frequency is how often those waves come towards you. It's how many vibrations you're going to have come past you per second. So, once again, while you're sitting at that beach before, if a wave would come every half second, that means you're going to get two waves per second. That would be the frequency. So it's vibrations per second. That's how we measure frequency. So period, it was seconds per vibration. And frequency is vibration per second. They're exactly the inverse of each other. They're just flip-flopped from one another. And the units for frequency is something called hertz. Hz is the abbreviation for that. And so on that example I was using with waves, if you have two waves hitting you every second, that means the frequency would be two hertz-- two vibrations or two waves per second is how we talk through that. And you can see here, if you have a very high frequency, the waves are going to be very short because you have to get more waves past you. This is a longer wavelength. And so the frequency would actually go down on those. And light-- we're going to be talking about visible light right here. Visible light-- not all light has the same frequency. In fact, violet light is a much higher frequency than red light. The wavelength is shorter over here. So that means it has a higher frequency. So this is high. This is low. So this is violet right here. So when you have ultraviolet, which is this area right here-- down here-- that means it has a higher frequency than violet. And infrared rays-- that means it has a lower frequency than red rays. So all light-- they all have different frequencies. And all electromagnetic radiation has different frequencies, as well-- gamma rays having the highest and AM radio waves having the smallest. So let's talk about wave speed. Waves move at a specific velocity. And we can calculate this by using this equation. Velocity equals wavelength divided by period. Remember, units-wise-- this is a wavelength right there-- and so really what we're saying is the meters-- we're going to measure something in meters divided by something in time. So we're going to get a unit of meters per second. Meters per second is a measurement of velocity. So that's the way to remember it. And make sure your units match up. And if you want to use frequency, we're going to be taking wavelength times frequency. So we have meters times [? enough ?] frequency-- the hertz-- is how many vibrations you have over one second. And if we just put one over seconds-- and this is going to be in units-- it'll be meters per second again. So if you can't remember which way is which-- whether it's wavelength times period or wavelength divided by period-- just look at the units and that should lead you to get to the right spot. Now let's do a math problem and practice. It says the string of a piano that produces the note middle C vibrates with a frequency of 264 hertz. If the sound waves produced by the string have a wavelength in the air of 1.3 meters, what is the speed [? in ?] the sound? So we write down what we know. We know the frequency is 240 hertz. And the wavelength is 1.3 meters. The unknown-- what we're trying to find is we're trying to find velocity. That's what we're trying to find. And so we write down the equation of velocity equals frequency-- that's times-- wavelength. And then we plug the numbers in and solve. So we put the frequency-- 264 hertz times 1.3 meters. And they just changed the units right there for you so that you know it's 1 over seconds. That's the same thing as 1 over seconds. And when we multiply it all out, we get about 343 meters per second. And that's actually a real amount. That's about how fast sound travels in air-- about 343 meters per second. So about about three and a half football fields per second is how fast sound travels. Let's practice one more. it says the average wavelength in a series of ocean waves is 15 meters. So there's the number. And a wave crest arrives at the shore on an average every 10 seconds. So that would be the period right there. And it gives you a frequency, as well. They found the frequency for you. It says, what is the average speed of the wave? So we're trying to find speed or velocity. They give you a wavelength of 15 meters. And they give us a frequency-- we'll use the frequency of 0.100 hertz. The equation's going to be velocity equals wavelength times frequency. So velocity equals 15.0 meters times 0.100 hertz. And we get an answer of 1.5 meters per second. So that's how we work it. We just write down what we know, plop it into the equation and get an answer. Let's talk about why waves would travel at different speeds. Sound actually travels at different speeds based on what substance the sound is traveling through. Sound travels faster through water or through a solid. If you've ever put your head on your desk and kind of tapped on the other side of the desk, it's really loud. And sound actually travels even faster through solids. The only thing that determines the speed of the wave is the medium that it travels through. You can increase the volume. You can increase the frequency. None of that affects the speed of the wave. The only thing that affects the speed of the wave is the medium. And the reason why this is the case-- the kinetic theory. What we're talking about-- the kinetic theory-- we're talking about how all substances are made of molecules. Now, if these molecules are further apart, like in a gas, they're not going to be able to hit each other and pass the energy on nearly as quickly as a solid, which is really tight. And they can just bump each other really easily. So it's because the solids are really tightly packed together-- the molecules are really close-- they're able to pass the energy that's created in a sound wave along much quicker-- in liquids-- a little bit quicker than air. Gases are always the slowest, then liquids, and then solids are the fastest. I have this picture of the dolphins here to talk about how sound does travel in water. I've been in swimming pools. And I always played a game as a kid where you'd both go under the water. And the other person would try to talk underwater. And the second person would try to understand what they're saying-- just a silly game. But I learned early that sound does travel. And it travels about three to four times faster in water than it does in air. Light, on the other hand, actually has a finite speed, meaning it stays the same. It's 3 times 10 to the eighth meters per second. And light, as it travels through space, it keeps that same speed. It's not going to change. Now, this next thing-- the Doppler effect to me is one of the cooler things. This is why-- if you've ever seen a car race or when you see the cars going past and you hear them go [IMITATING CAR] as they go past. And they start off a really high frequency. And then they get really low. they go [IMITATING CAR] as they go past. That is called a Doppler effect. What's happening there is-- we drew this picture right here with this car driving towards a person standing there. As the car's driving towards the person, the car is moving. The person is not. And with the car moving, it's producing a sound, as well. In this case, it's a police siren. Now, as this car is going, every fraction of time, another sound wave's produced. And they come off. And they go out towards everybody. It goes off in all different directions. As that car moves-- here's our car-- it's going to let off a wave. But the car's moving. And so when it lets off the next wave, they're going to be a little closer to each other. And so the waves in front of the car get closer to each other because the car is moving in that same direction. And the higher the frequency-- since those are closer to each other-- they're going to have a higher frequency. And that gives you a higher pitch. The waves behind-- because it's moving away-- so as it lets off one wave, it's going to move. And so when the second wave comes off, they're going to be further apart than what they normally would. And so what you do is you get a lower frequency back here, which creates a lower pitch. So, once again, frequency is what changes as objects are moving. When they're coming towards you, it's going to have a higher frequency, which creates a higher pitch. And then when it's going away from you, it's going to have a lower frequency or a lower pitch. So that's why you get the [IMITATING CAR] as it goes past you is because those waves get crunched together on the front side. And they get spread apart on the back side. So in review, we talked about the crest and a trough. Here's a wave. Remember, here's a crest. Here's a trough. The amplitude is from the equilibrium spot up to the top or from the equilibrium spot down to the bottom. The wavelength is the distance from wherever a wave repeats itself. Usually from crest to crest is an easy way to remember it. Frequency is how often that vibration is occurring. And we measure it in hertz-- 10 times per second-- 10 waves per second. And then period is just the inverse of that. It's how much time goes by between each vibration. So they're very closely related to each other. And then we did some calculations involving speed, frequency and wavelength using those equations. It's just three variables. And you just plug and solve. And then we talked about the Doppler effect-- how we get higher pitches from objects coming towards us and lower pitches from objects that are going away from us. To me, I love this lesson because you see it every day. You hear it every day. Sound is definitely a big part of our lives. And most of today's lesson involves sound. And hopefully, you have a better understanding of why you hear what you do. So, have a great day and take care.
