TEACHER: Hi, and welcome to today's lesson in physical science. My name is Mr. [? Provencha, ?] and I'll be your instructor today as we learn about waves. There's two objectives in today's lesson. The first is just to learn about something called a mechanical wave. And then we're going to break that mechanical
00:00:15
wave into two parts. And we're going to learn about those different parts, longitudinal and transverse waves. Before we can get to that part, we do need to learn about the basics of a wave first. And the first question that I think we need to answer is, what is a wave? A wave is some sort of disturbance that occurs in a
00:00:33
substance that transfers energy throughout that substance. OK, let me repeat that so you get it. A wave is a disturbance in a substance that transfers energy from one part of the substance to another. OK, so a wave transfers energy. And we're going to talk about how and why in just a little bit.
00:00:54
OK, so what carries the waves? In order to get a wave to move, at least a mechanical wave-- this is what we're gong to talk about right now, a mechanical wave-- in order to get one of those to move, you have to have a substance for the wave to pass through. For instance, in this picture right here, that wave is using water to travel.
00:01:12
And water is what would be called it's medium. The medium, that's just the definition. The definition of a medium, it's the substance that the wave travels through. OK, so the medium that you're hearing me through is air. My air, I'm speaking. My waves go to the microphone on the camera, and then it goes to the speakers.
00:01:32
Then the speakers use sound waves to get it to your ear. So-- and those sound waves are mechanical waves. When you go into outer space, sound waves don't work in outer space, because there is no medium there. There's no substance at all. Despite what the movies are trying to tell you, we will not hear anything out in outer space.
00:01:51
Astronauts can because they have the helmets on, so they're little mic, their speakers, their headphones can produce sound for people talking to them inside their uniform. But outside, if you could have your head outside in space, you couldn't hear anything. Light travels through space, because it is not a mechanical wave.
00:02:09
That's for a lesson another time. But mechanical waves, sound is a great example. Shock waves going through the ground, those types of things, a slinky, playing with a slinky, those are all mechanical waves, because they have a substance for it to travel through. Well, how do waves transfer energy? You have to remember that all substances are made of tiny
00:02:28
little particles that are near each other. And as one particle of that substance gets disturbed, it's going to move. And what's going to happen is it's going to bump into the one next to it, which will then bump into next to it, and then bump into the next one. And so as they bump into each other, they're going to pass the energy down the line to the particles next to it, and
00:02:47
so forth and so forth. And they're going to keep going down the line. That's how the energy gets transferred through the substances. It goes down to the molecular level of those molecules bumping into each other and passing that energy along. And what causes a wave? Well, you're going to have to have some--
00:03:02
I used the term disturbance before-- you're going to have to have some sort of disturbance that brings energy into the substance. For example, a boy jumping into a swimming pool makes a big splash, and you see waves going out from that boy. That boy jumping into the water had energy. It transferred some of that energy into the water. And that energy was transferred along the surface
00:03:25
of the water as a wave. Now, there's two different types of waves we're going to talk about. There's a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave. First we're going to talk about transverse waves. In order to make a transverse wave, you have to make a vibration that is perpendicular to the direction you want to go.
00:03:42
For instance, this one, this person is shaking this up and down, but the wave is actually travelling in that direction. And so that's what a transverse wave is, is that they're perpendicular to the motion. So we say-- I should say the vibration. And the vibration is just really, it's a repetitive disturbance.
00:04:01
You're going back and forth. You're disturbing the medium over and over and over again. And then the next one is called a longitudinal wave. And that's this right here. A longitudinal wave, what happens there is you actually go back and forth in the same direction as the motion. OK? So longitudinal wave is sound.
00:04:19
This is an example of sound. Would be an example of a longitudinal wave. And with longitudinal wave, what's happening is you're pushing and pulling over and over with the-- see how he's pushing and pulling. And you get what are called compressions and rarefactions. These rarefactions, I like to call them, with my students, elongation spots, where it gets longer.
00:04:40
So there are spots were it gets compressed and spots where it gets elongated. Those are called compressions and rarefactions. Basically, that's what a longitudinal wave is. It's sometimes called a compressional wave. You'll hear it called that as well. OK, so that's a transverse wave, goes up and down. It's perpendicular and that forms--
00:04:59
remember maybe perpendicular as a T. That's the symbol for perpendicular. You can remember transverse, upside down T A longitudinal is parallel. They go in the same direction. OK, so that's today's lesson. We talked about mechanical waves. Remember, you have to have a medium for
00:05:14
it to travel through. The mechanical waves take energy from one part of the substance to another. And then the two types of waves we talked about were longitudinal waves, which is like a compressional wave, and then a transverse wave, which you shake it perpendicular and the wave goes away from you. OK?
00:05:30
And that's today's lesson. Have a great day and take care.
