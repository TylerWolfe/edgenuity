**The material through which a wave travels is called a(n) ____________________.**

medium

**How does the motion of the particles of the medium differ between transverse and longitudinal waves?**

The particles of the medium move perpendicular to the direction in which a transverse wave is traveling. The particles of the medium move parallel to the direction in which a longitudinal wave is traveling.

the direction in which the wave is moving

**What type of wave makes up sound?**

Sound is a compression wave.

**A mechanical wave is created when a medium ____________________, or moves back and forth or up and down.**

vibrates

**What is the medium through which the wave is moving?**

the rope

**In a longitudinal wave moving along a spring, what are areas where the coils are farthest apart called?**

rarefactions

**Give the names of the highest and lowest points of a transverse wave.**

This highest point is called the crest, and the lowest point is called the trough.

**In what direction does the medium move relative to the direction of the wave? Explain.**

The medium moves perpendicular, or at right angles, to the wave; the rope moves up and down vertically and the wave moves horizontally.

**What kind of wave is being generated?**
