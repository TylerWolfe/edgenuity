**If a wave has a period of 0.25 seconds, what is its frequency?**

4 hertz

**Why does sound travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases?**

When a particle of a medium is disturbed, it will cause a neighboring particle to be disturbed. The closer the particles are and the more tightly they are bound, the faster the disturbance will travel through the medium. The particles of solids are very close together, the particles of liquids are not as close, and the particles of a gas are relatively far away from each other.

**Suppose ocean waves are hitting a shore at a frequency of 20 waves per minute. Two swimmers are in the water. One swimmer says the frequency is 25 waves per minute and the other says the frequency is 15 waves per minute. How can the Doppler effect explain this apparent difference?**

One swimmer is swimming out to sea and is moving against the direction the waves are traveling, which causes the swimmer to encounter a wave 25 times per minute. The other swimmer is swimming toward shore in the same direction the waves are traveling, so that swimmer encounters waves less frequently.

**A wave x meters long has a speed of y meters per second. The frequency of the wave is**

y/x hertz

**The highest point of a transverse wave is called the _______, while the lowest point of a traverse wave is called the _______.**

crest; trough

**What is the relationship between wavelength, speed and frequency?**

wave speed (in m/s) = frequency (in Hz) x wavelength (m)

**The ____________________ is the time required for one full wavelength to pass a certain point.**

period

**The ____________________ is the number of vibrations that occur in a 1-second time interval.**

frequency

**In the case of mechanical waves, what causes or determines the speed of the waves, the frequency of the waves, and the wavelengths of the waves?**

The speed of the wave is determined by the characteristics of the medium. The frequency of the wave is determined by the source of the wave. For example, if the frequency of a sound wave in air is 550 Hz, it is because a tuning fork or guitar string is vibrating 550 times per second. The medium and the frequency then determine the wavelength in accordance with the wave speed equation.

**The ____________________ is the greatest distance that particles in a medium move from their normal position when a wave passes.**

amplitude
